INTERN ID: CTO4DF154

DOMAIN: C++ PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIBTION-> This project is a visually engaging Snake Game developed in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game demonstrates essential concepts of game development, including graphics rendering, real-time input handling, sound effects, collision detection, and difficulty scaling.

-> The Snake Game is designed with progressively increasing difficulty, where the game speed accelerates as the snake grows by eating food. It includes sound effects for key actions like eating and game over, enhancing the gameplay experience. The game uses a grid-based system to manage snake movement and food spawning, making it highly responsive and smooth.

-> Built as part of a game development assignment or internship, this project serves as a practical demonstration of using multimedia libraries like SFML in C++ to create interactive, real- time games. It also lays the foundation for understanding more complex game mechanics and engine architecture.

ðŸ§  Key Features -> Fully graphical interface using SFML

-> Smooth keyboard-based controls (arrow keys)

-> Real-time snake movement with increasing speed

-> Grid-based collision detection and logic

-> Sound effects for "food eaten" and "game over" events

-> Score tracking and on-screen display using SFML fonts

-> Modular, object-oriented design for readability and scalability
